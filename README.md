The internet is full of **Thought Leaders**. They exist everywhere - tweeting, blogging, sometimes even appearing in person - always leading with their thoughts. 

No one, to my knowledge, has assembled the authoritative list of internal thought leaders (known to us on the inside as "TLs"; other acceptable terms are **Key Opinion Leaders** and **Luminaries**.) It is my intention that this will be a living list of such individuals.
